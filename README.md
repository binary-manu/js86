# js86, a JavaScript-based 16-bit x86 toy disassembler

This is an educational project I wrote while learning JavaScript. It can decode
16 bit x86 machine code and present it as Intel-style mnemonics (i.e. `mov, ax,
10`).

It has no real use but showing some JavaScript patterns and a way to
disassemble 16-bit x86 code, for those who are interested.

View it on [GitHUb Pages](https://binary-manu.github.io/js86/).
